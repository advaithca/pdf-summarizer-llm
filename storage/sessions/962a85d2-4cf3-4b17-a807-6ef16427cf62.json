Changes inurban environment enforce updating of old records,which can help planners to have accurate roadnetwork for road planning, maintenance and\ndevelopment. Automatic road extraction from\nremotely sensed imagery has attracted muchattention during last decade. Generally roadextraction is based on different kinds of knowledgeabout roads: geometric, spatial, spectral, radiometryand topological. Road extraction consists of four\nmain steps: road sharpening, road finding, road\ntracking and road linking (Hu et al., 2004; Gruen and\nLi, 1995). In an urban environment automaticextraction of roads does not provide satisfactoryresults due to technical hurdles introduced bymultilevel construction e.g. high-rise buildings,\ntunnels and flyovers also have a significant influence\non road extraction. Automatically extracted urbanroads are affected by shadows of buildings,boundary edges, trees reflection on road edge, etc.therefore, this needs much post editing. Severalattempts have been made in remote sensing to extract\nurban roads (Morgan and Tempfli, 2000; Tao and\nYasuoka, 2002; Wang and Trinder, 2000; Zhan et al .,\n2002d). Increase in availability of high-resolutionsatellite images and ALS data has resulted in\naddressing the problem of road extraction moreefficiently. High-resolution satellite image provides\na good basis for reorganization and monitoring of\nstructural changes to map urban details.

There are manychallenges to be faced because urban areas are verycomplex across fine spatial scales. At such Highspatial resolutions automatic road extraction does\nnot give desired result, as it leads to misinter-\npretation of features (man made objects like flyovers,bridges and road above tunnel as ground roads or\nroad junctions). Automatic road extraction in urban\nareas also suffers with the mixing of road andbuilding edges. Roads are generally constructed\nparallel to buildings, cycle tracks, sidewalks, which\ncause road extraction more difficult as they leadmixing of their edges. Certain road features like thebridges, flyovers, culverts, etc. are possibly difficultto distinguish from other topographic features.Automated road extraction in dense urban\nenvironment using high resolution imagery suffering\nfrom the primary obstacles, which lead to unreliableand incomplete road extraction caused by shadowsof buildings, trees and other moving objects (Huet al., 2004). Some existing models (Hinz et al., 1999)\nare sensitive to disturbances like cars, shadows or\ndifferent hindrances.\nAn integration of high-resolution satellite data\nand airborne laser scanning data offer exciting\npossibilities for automatic and accurate road\nextraction (Zhan, 2003). Automatic extraction of road\nusing ALS is still one of the challenges in digital\nphotogrammetry and Geo-information sciences\n(Baltsavias and Zhang, 2004). It is necessary todevelop an automatic system, which can extract roadinformation accurately and without any effect ofbackground objects like cars, trees, or buildings.\nLiterature review\nTao and Yasuoka (2002) proposed a method to\ncombine high-resolution satellite imagery andairborne laser scanning data for generating bare-earth DEM in urban areas. Tree features are\n\n225 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens. (June 2009) 37:223–231\ncalculated through NDVI. They have taken care of\nroad features, which are covered by tree and shadowsand used a slope based filtering technique andmorphological operators to detect buildings. Due toaccuracy in height, ALS data is used. The method\nof nDEM (normalised digital elevation model)\ngeneration is successful but still it needs somerefinements. It can be considerably improved byspectral classification with combination of elevationvalues. Bare earth DEM can be well-generated usingground truth data. The ground truth data is needed\nto validate the truthfulness of DEM and DTM\ngeneration. Another success of feature extraction isreported by Zhan et al.  (2002d) in the combination\nof high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne laser\nscanning for land use classification. Technologicalaspects like image segmentation, thresholding,\ntriangulation and morphological techniques are\nused to classify urban features. Different objectsare classified using an object-oriented approach.The researchers realised that the urban areas arecomplicated, so a comprehensive approach isneeded and different settings have to be investigated\nto cope with the different urban areas. They\nrecommended that spatial object based modelling cangive better identification of features. Hu et al.  (2004)\nhave given a method to extract roads automaticallyusing high-resolution satellite in combination withLiDAR data. An interpretation of these technologies\nis tested on an urban area of Toronto, Canada, which\nis a highly dense urban area. Using high-resolutionsatellite imagery, it is difficult to extract roadscompletely because building boundaries, trees, andshadow obstruct the road patterns. They describedroad in urban area as grid pattern. LiDAR data wereused to extract road strips. An object-orientedapproach and morphological operation was used toobtain road strips and parking areas. To extractstraight road lane, an iterative Hough transformtechnique is applied. Finally roads were verified\nusing some rules. The method is successful for\nextracting grid roads in urban areas with dense\nbuildings and LiDAR data was used to eliminateobstruction of the roads. He recommended that theaccuracy of road the road extraction was affected bycompleteness and correctness, which can be\nincreased using multi-source imageries.\nData used and study area\nThe urban area chosen for addressing the study\nproblem is Amsterdam in The Netherlands.\nAmsterdam is bounded by graticule 52° 35’ N 4° 9’ E\n(Fig. 1). Altitude of the city is between – 5 and 40 m.\nIt is one of the largest, most beautiful and planned\ncities in Europe, situated around a dam across AmstelRiver. The study is conducted in a 9 km\n2 area of\nAmsterdam. The study area is located betweengeographic extent of 52° 17’ 22.74\" N to 52° 19’ 03.15\"N (latitude) and 4° 55’ 33.24\" E to 4° 57’ 51.42\" E\n(longitude). LiDAR and IKONOS images of the\nstudy area are shown in Figs. 2(a,b) respectively. Theterrain is regular with a flat  topography.\nStrategy for road extraction\nInformation content in PAN is higher as a result of\nits higher spatial resolution whereas MSS enables\nTable 1   Data used for the study\nS.

Optimally, the best image for micro-level field study (as is the case with the presentstudy) is the one that has the highest informationcontents of both PAN and MSS. A trade off wasinevitable with little or no loss of image information.\nImage fusion, a widely accepted technique for\narriving at such images was utilized. It is defined as“a combination of two or more different images toform a new image by using certain algorithms” (Pohland Genderen, 1998). Conceptually, Image Fusion isa way of combining the spectral information of a\ncoarse-resolution image with the information at a\nfiner spatial resolution of a second image. The resultsynergistically combines the best features of eachof its components for better visualization. Imagefusion based on Principal Components Analysismethod was carried out because the spectralproperties have to be conserved. Informationextraction from high-resolution satellite imagery canbe achieved through sub-pixel classifiers and object-oriented techniques (Lee and Warner, 2004; Oruc\net al.,  2004) Structural stochastic or knowledge-based\nmethods consider spatial characteristics (shape, size\nand area-perimeter ratio). Knowledge-based methodsare needed to increase classification accuracy byseparating features like building and roads from otherimages information and to generate a suitable multi-\nsource/multi classifier for urban regions (Chen et al.,\n2004) for these methods sequence of processing\nsteps is initially defined followed by setting theparameters and initialization criteria (Granzow, 2001).Fig. 1 Location of the study area.\nFig. 2 Data used (a) LiDAR, (b) IKONOS.(a)\n(b)\n(a)(b)\n\n227 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens. (June 2009) 37:223–231\nMulti-resolution segmentation allows the\nsegmentation of an image into a network of\nhomogeneous image regions at any chosenresolution. These image object primitives representimage information in an abstracted form serving as\nbuilding blocks and information carriers for\nsubsequent classification, beyond purely spectralinformation, image objects contain a lot of additionalattributes which can be used for classification:shape, texture and – operating over the network – awhole set of relational/contextual information. The\nbasic element of an object-oriented approach is the\nimage object or segment is not single pixel.\nKnowledge Base provides an intelligent and\nintegrated knowledge solution that promotes easyimage information extraction. Generally knowledgebase summarizes all the algorithms, definitions and\nparameters necessary to process information to a\ncertain purpose. It contains the specific domainknowledge to solve the problem. Various rules wereapplied for classifying road segments. Spectral,shape, textural and contextural properties of theobjects were utilized for formulating rules for road\nextraction (Fig. 3a). Lidar Data was processed to\ngenerate Digital surface model. Lidar point cloud wasfiltered to classify ground and non ground points(Fig. 3b). Height threshold was applied to extractedroads using lidar point cloud to separate out groundroad and elevated roads (Fig. 3c).\nTo evaluate the success of the results of road\nextraction, the extracted roads were subjected to anaccuracy assessment. Accuracy is the degree ofconformity with a true reference. Wiedemann et al.\n(1998) have suggested certain algorithms to checkthe accuracy. The quality of each road can beevaluated by contemplating the completeness and\ncorrectness of the extracted road network. The\ncontiguity of the two road networks (reference andextracted road) may lack in coherence, hence theaccuracy cannot be judged directly. Buffer methodcan be used for accuracy assessment of auto-matically extracted data with respect to reference\ndata. This method works depending on buffer\ngenerated with threshold distance around the roadnetwork. For assessment of completeness, a bufferof constant predefined width is constructed aroundthe reference road data. The parts of the extractedroad data lying with in the buffer are considered as\nmatched extraction and outside the buffer as non-\nroad or unmatched extraction. The matched extracted\n  (a)              (b) (c)\nFig. 3 (a)  Roads extracted with object oriented rule based classification, (b) Filtered Lidar data, (c) Ground and\nelevated roads.\n\n228 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens. (June 2009) 37:223–231\nroad is denoted as true positive whereas unmatched\nextraction as false positive. For correctness, a buffer\nis built around the extracted road network with usingpredefined threshold value and the parts of referencedata lying in the buffer are considered as matched\n(Fig. 4).Quality = \nreference) unmatchedof length extractionof (length  ) extraction matchedof (length \n+\nQuality ∈ {0; 1}.\nThe optimum value for completeness, correctness\nand quality is 1.\nFig. 4    Accuracy assessment strategy.\nThe parameters are defined and calculated using\nthese formulas:\n“Completeness  is the ratio of the correctly\nextracted records to the total no of relevant recordswithin the ground truth data”, and can be calculatedas-\nCompleteness = \nreferenceof length reference matchedof length \nCompleteness ∈ {0; 1}.\n“Correctness  is the ratio of the number of relevant\nrecords extracted to the total number of the relevantand irrelevant record retrieval”, and can be calculatedas-\nCorrectness = \nextractionof length extraction matchedof length \nCorrectness ∈ {0; 1}.\n“Quality  is the measure of final result combining\ncompleteness and correctness”, and can becalculated as-Results and analysis\nIn the case of road, completeness of 76.26% and\ncorrectness of 50.78% was achieved. The overallaccuracy observed for the road extraction was43.85%. With this result it was evaluated that morethan 3/4 part of the whole road network wascompletely extracted with the correctness of nearly\nhalf of the total road network (Fig. 5).\nWhile in the case of elevated road/flyover, a\ncompleteness of 88.61% and correctness of 85.71%\nachieved. The overall accuracy of the elevated roadextraction was examined as 77.21%. The outputresult shows that most of the part of elevated road\nnetwork was completely and correctly extracted to\nthe total road network. The output results of roadsand elevated roads are compared in Fig. 6. In thestudy area, urban scene was highly complex andcontained high-rise buildings, open-grounds,medium-rise buildings, etc. which mainly affected the\naccuracy of road extraction. Figure 5 indicates some\nof them.\n\n229 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens.

(June 2009) 37:223–231\n•In Fig. 5(a) and (f), we can see that roads,\nstadium top and building top have similarspectral reflectance.\n•Figure 5(b), (c) and (d), these are some of thesnap shots of roads, which are surrounded by\ntrees. The roads can be better reconstructed\nin these places, if trees can be extracted out.NDVI can help in extraction of trees. Once the\ntrees are extracted out, the better road\nextraction can be expected.\n•Figure 5(e) shows, shadows of high-rise\nbuildings are falling on the road. Classification\nusing fuzzy approach normally labels highmembership value to each object withrespect to others. The larger differencebetween the highest and lowest membershipvalue sometimes extract other object also.\nConclusion\nRoads are important features in urban context. Urban\nplanners need methodologies for fast road dataacquisition, which can be done through satelliteremote sensing techniques and airborne laser data.\nAutomatic extraction of road network information\nusing remotely sensed data suffers with someproblems, especially in urban areas due to spectralcomplexity in the scene. To overcome such problemsan integrated approach of high-resolution satellitedata and LiDAR data have been studied, which can\nextract urban road efficiently with the help of\ncommercially available softwares. Here high-resolution data have been used to extract groundroads. The combination of LiDAR and IKONOS datawas further used to provide a smooth road network,so as to eliminate edges other than the roads. A\nmethodology for automatically extracting and\nrecognizing roads has been attempted. However,\nsoftware limitation was one of the challenges of theresearch.\nThe integrated approach of high-resolution\nsatellite data and LiDAR has shown their best resultsusing commercially available softwares. But still\nthere are further scope for research, which can resultin better accuracy of extraction.\nReferences\nBaltsavias E and Zhang C (2005) Automated updating of\nroad databases from aerial imagery.

It can be considerably improved byspectral classification with combination of elevationvalues. Bare earth DEM can be well-generated usingground truth data. The ground truth data is needed\nto validate the truthfulness of DEM and DTM\ngeneration. Another success of feature extraction isreported by Zhan et al.  (2002d) in the combination\nof high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne laser\nscanning for land use classification. Technologicalaspects like image segmentation, thresholding,\ntriangulation and morphological techniques are\nused to classify urban features. Different objectsare classified using an object-oriented approach.The researchers realised that the urban areas arecomplicated, so a comprehensive approach isneeded and different settings have to be investigated\nto cope with the different urban areas. They\nrecommended that spatial object based modelling cangive better identification of features. Hu et al.  (2004)\nhave given a method to extract roads automaticallyusing high-resolution satellite in combination withLiDAR data. An interpretation of these technologies\nis tested on an urban area of Toronto, Canada, which\nis a highly dense urban area. Using high-resolutionsatellite imagery, it is difficult to extract roadscompletely because building boundaries, trees, andshadow obstruct the road patterns. They describedroad in urban area as grid pattern. LiDAR data wereused to extract road strips. An object-orientedapproach and morphological operation was used toobtain road strips and parking areas. To extractstraight road lane, an iterative Hough transformtechnique is applied. Finally roads were verified\nusing some rules. The method is successful for\nextracting grid roads in urban areas with dense\nbuildings and LiDAR data was used to eliminateobstruction of the roads. He recommended that theaccuracy of road the road extraction was affected bycompleteness and correctness, which can be\nincreased using multi-source imageries.\nData used and study area\nThe urban area chosen for addressing the study\nproblem is Amsterdam in The Netherlands.\nAmsterdam is bounded by graticule 52° 35’ N 4° 9’ E\n(Fig. 1). Altitude of the city is between – 5 and 40 m.\nIt is one of the largest, most beautiful and planned\ncities in Europe, situated around a dam across AmstelRiver. The study is conducted in a 9 km\n2 area of\nAmsterdam. The study area is located betweengeographic extent of 52° 17’ 22.74\" N to 52° 19’ 03.15\"N (latitude) and 4° 55’ 33.24\" E to 4° 57’ 51.42\" E\n(longitude). LiDAR and IKONOS images of the\nstudy area are shown in Figs. 2(a,b) respectively. Theterrain is regular with a flat  topography.\nStrategy for road extraction\nInformation content in PAN is higher as a result of\nits higher spatial resolution whereas MSS enables\nTable 1   Data used for the study\nS.

Optimally, the best image for micro-level field study (as is the case with the presentstudy) is the one that has the highest informationcontents of both PAN and MSS. A trade off wasinevitable with little or no loss of image information.\nImage fusion, a widely accepted technique for\narriving at such images was utilized. It is defined as“a combination of two or more different images toform a new image by using certain algorithms” (Pohland Genderen, 1998). Conceptually, Image Fusion isa way of combining the spectral information of a\ncoarse-resolution image with the information at a\nfiner spatial resolution of a second image. The resultsynergistically combines the best features of eachof its components for better visualization. Imagefusion based on Principal Components Analysismethod was carried out because the spectralproperties have to be conserved. Informationextraction from high-resolution satellite imagery canbe achieved through sub-pixel classifiers and object-oriented techniques (Lee and Warner, 2004; Oruc\net al.,  2004) Structural stochastic or knowledge-based\nmethods consider spatial characteristics (shape, size\nand area-perimeter ratio). Knowledge-based methodsare needed to increase classification accuracy byseparating features like building and roads from otherimages information and to generate a suitable multi-\nsource/multi classifier for urban regions (Chen et al.,\n2004) for these methods sequence of processing\nsteps is initially defined followed by setting theparameters and initialization criteria (Granzow, 2001).Fig. 1 Location of the study area.\nFig. 2 Data used (a) LiDAR, (b) IKONOS.(a)\n(b)\n(a)(b)\n\n227 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens. (June 2009) 37:223–231\nMulti-resolution segmentation allows the\nsegmentation of an image into a network of\nhomogeneous image regions at any chosenresolution. These image object primitives representimage information in an abstracted form serving as\nbuilding blocks and information carriers for\nsubsequent classification, beyond purely spectralinformation, image objects contain a lot of additionalattributes which can be used for classification:shape, texture and – operating over the network – awhole set of relational/contextual information. The\nbasic element of an object-oriented approach is the\nimage object or segment is not single pixel.\nKnowledge Base provides an intelligent and\nintegrated knowledge solution that promotes easyimage information extraction. Generally knowledgebase summarizes all the algorithms, definitions and\nparameters necessary to process information to a\ncertain purpose. It contains the specific domainknowledge to solve the problem. Various rules wereapplied for classifying road segments. Spectral,shape, textural and contextural properties of theobjects were utilized for formulating rules for road\nextraction (Fig. 3a). Lidar Data was processed to\ngenerate Digital surface model. Lidar point cloud wasfiltered to classify ground and non ground points(Fig. 3b). Height threshold was applied to extractedroads using lidar point cloud to separate out groundroad and elevated roads (Fig. 3c).\nTo evaluate the success of the results of road\nextraction, the extracted roads were subjected to anaccuracy assessment. Accuracy is the degree ofconformity with a true reference. Wiedemann et al.\n(1998) have suggested certain algorithms to checkthe accuracy. The quality of each road can beevaluated by contemplating the completeness and\ncorrectness of the extracted road network. The\ncontiguity of the two road networks (reference andextracted road) may lack in coherence, hence theaccuracy cannot be judged directly. Buffer methodcan be used for accuracy assessment of auto-matically extracted data with respect to reference\ndata. This method works depending on buffer\ngenerated with threshold distance around the roadnetwork. For assessment of completeness, a bufferof constant predefined width is constructed aroundthe reference road data. The parts of the extractedroad data lying with in the buffer are considered as\nmatched extraction and outside the buffer as non-\nroad or unmatched extraction. The matched extracted\n  (a)              (b) (c)\nFig. 3 (a)  Roads extracted with object oriented rule based classification, (b) Filtered Lidar data, (c) Ground and\nelevated roads.\n\n228 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens. (June 2009) 37:223–231\nroad is denoted as true positive whereas unmatched\nextraction as false positive. For correctness, a buffer\nis built around the extracted road network with usingpredefined threshold value and the parts of referencedata lying in the buffer are considered as matched\n(Fig. 4).Quality = \nreference) unmatchedof length extractionof (length  ) extraction matchedof (length \n+\nQuality ∈ {0; 1}.\nThe optimum value for completeness, correctness\nand quality is 1.\nFig. 4    Accuracy assessment strategy.\nThe parameters are defined and calculated using\nthese formulas:\n“Completeness  is the ratio of the correctly\nextracted records to the total no of relevant recordswithin the ground truth data”, and can be calculatedas-\nCompleteness = \nreferenceof length reference matchedof length \nCompleteness ∈ {0; 1}.\n“Correctness  is the ratio of the number of relevant\nrecords extracted to the total number of the relevantand irrelevant record retrieval”, and can be calculatedas-\nCorrectness = \nextractionof length extraction matchedof length \nCorrectness ∈ {0; 1}.\n“Quality  is the measure of final result combining\ncompleteness and correctness”, and can becalculated as-Results and analysis\nIn the case of road, completeness of 76.26% and\ncorrectness of 50.78% was achieved. The overallaccuracy observed for the road extraction was43.85%. With this result it was evaluated that morethan 3/4 part of the whole road network wascompletely extracted with the correctness of nearly\nhalf of the total road network (Fig. 5).\nWhile in the case of elevated road/flyover, a\ncompleteness of 88.61% and correctness of 85.71%\nachieved. The overall accuracy of the elevated roadextraction was examined as 77.21%. The outputresult shows that most of the part of elevated road\nnetwork was completely and correctly extracted to\nthe total road network. The output results of roadsand elevated roads are compared in Fig. 6. In thestudy area, urban scene was highly complex andcontained high-rise buildings, open-grounds,medium-rise buildings, etc. which mainly affected the\naccuracy of road extraction. Figure 5 indicates some\nof them.\n\n229 J. Indian Soc. Remote Sens.

(June 2009) 37:223–231\n•In Fig. 5(a) and (f), we can see that roads,\nstadium top and building top have similarspectral reflectance.\n•Figure 5(b), (c) and (d), these are some of thesnap shots of roads, which are surrounded by\ntrees. The roads can be better reconstructed\nin these places, if trees can be extracted out.NDVI can help in extraction of trees. Once the\ntrees are extracted out, the better road\nextraction can be expected.\n•Figure 5(e) shows, shadows of high-rise\nbuildings are falling on the road. Classification\nusing fuzzy approach normally labels highmembership value to each object withrespect to others. The larger differencebetween the highest and lowest membershipvalue sometimes extract other object also.\nConclusion\nRoads are important features in urban context. Urban\nplanners need methodologies for fast road dataacquisition, which can be done through satelliteremote sensing techniques and airborne laser data.\nAutomatic extraction of road network information\nusing remotely sensed data suffers with someproblems, especially in urban areas due to spectralcomplexity in the scene. To overcome such problemsan integrated approach of high-resolution satellitedata and LiDAR data have been studied, which can\nextract urban road efficiently with the help of\ncommercially available softwares. Here high-resolution data have been used to extract groundroads. The combination of LiDAR and IKONOS datawas further used to provide a smooth road network,so as to eliminate edges other than the roads. A\nmethodology for automatically extracting and\nrecognizing roads has been attempted. However,\nsoftware limitation was one of the challenges of theresearch.\nThe integrated approach of high-resolution\nsatellite data and LiDAR has shown their best resultsusing commercially available softwares. But still\nthere are further scope for research, which can resultin better accuracy of extraction.\nReferences\nBaltsavias E and Zhang C (2005) Automated updating of\nroad databases from aerial imagery.
